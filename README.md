# Web Developement

Some of the projects need JavaScript tools

## Requirements
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)


## Start the application

There is one application by folder, to start some applications :

```bash
# Head to the desired exercise
$ cd exercice
# Start the application
$ npm install
$ node app.js
# You can install nodemon (automatically restart your server), so you don't need to type node app.js everytime, and you only need to install it once
$ npm install nodemon
$ nodemon app.js
```

You can then access the frontend on : [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
